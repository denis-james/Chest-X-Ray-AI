The code contained in the three .ipynb files are self sufficient to train a CNN model a test the models accuracy.

After running the first block of code that imports all the necessary module, all that needs to be done is to copy paste the path to the folder (containing the "train" and "test" folder)
in the second code block in all the three .ipynb files and run each code block one by one.

Remember:
The training part requires high computation and takes hours to train.
